# LunarCore-BrawlStars

After I saw Tail's nodebrawl-core <a href="url">github.com/tailsjs/nodebrawl-core</a> server started think myself. what If I do similiar Packet Management in Python too? and yea it's here Let me explain

It's works like this

- Packets and Commands loading into memory before Socket Server binding also CSV Data loading too

- Passing to Client Thread, it's not create a class for every player

Also it's comfortable I mean you don't need to write all packets manually, just create a file write ID inside it and run server 

I did same thing for commands too there 2 type commands loading into memory (Client, Server)


# What I need to run this server?

I wrote database, CSV reader, Packet manager you just need to write OwnHomeData and other packets
